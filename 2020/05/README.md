# DAY 5

So, go doesn't have a min/max function on arrays? interesting. Also dirty hack for
figuring out the min value (i suppose I could have checked for uninitialised).

I originally though of doing some cool bit shifting, but parsing the string from binary
was just a whole bunch easier and cleaner </shrug>
