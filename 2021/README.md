# AoC 2021!

So, I thought to do this in Rust this year since it's the Cool New Hip Language That's Not Actually
That Old At All (CNHLTNATOAAT).

What you can expect in this folder:
- A file per day which contains both parts
- Each part will load the file input from disk and do all the work
  - Yes, even if this doesn't make sense, because it could be reused between funcs
  - Why? Because I want to perf everything, and this makes it "fair" per challenge
- Budget and bad code on the first days
- Better, but still bad code on the latter days
- Shortcuts, hacks, things I wouldn't do in production
- Tests? Hah... Yes I should do TDD, but that's next year. Check out [trekdemo](https://github.com/trekdemo)
  if you want to see someone doing TDD like a true champ
